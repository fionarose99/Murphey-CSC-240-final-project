# Pre-Alpha
## Project Description
- Initial Idea: For my final project, I will create a Galaga clone. I will use a potentiometer to control the x-position of the player spaceship and pseudorandom number generation to instantiate enemy spaceships at x-positions. Enemy spaceships will then fire bullets at the player spaceship; the player will attempt to avoid being hit.

- New idea: After examining the character map, I decided instead to make a miniature Undertale clone. An avatar of Flowey will sit at the top of the screen, composed of a smiley-face (which happens to look almost exactly like his face in Undertale) and an up-arrow. I will use a potentiometer to control the x-position of a heart avatar along a fixed y-coordinate (in place of a spaceship). Instead of avoiding enemy spaceship bullets, the goal will be to avoid the bullets themselves in a bullet-hell style game (as Undertale pays homage to). Starting x-coordinates of bullets will be pseudorandomly generated. They will start at the top of the screen and travel downwards, hopefully at a variety of speeds. When they reach the bottom, if the heart manages to avoid them, the game will start over with new x-coordinates for the bullets.
